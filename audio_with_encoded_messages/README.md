# Information on Encoded Audio

I have provided these audio files with messages already
encoded in them to help test your decoding program. Below are
the names of the audio files in this folder with the expected output
once the samples are decoded:

### File: TheMoonLanding.wav

### Expected Output: 
  Hello, World!

### File: FinestHour.wav

  #### Expected Output: 
  abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!@#$%^&*()

### File: Vietnam.wav

  ### Expected Output: 
  Hello there,
  I have hidden information in this audio file.
  Please let me know if you were able to decode it.
  Thanks!
  David
